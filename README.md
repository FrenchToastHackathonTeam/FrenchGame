# French Gaming Challange

## Background
The goal of the challange was to create a game that teaches french to students. As some of the team are students in universities and all were recently in highschool, we took this to heart and, though how can we create the best experiance to learn/teach french from both the student and teacher perspective.

After reading several studies and researching the effects of different types of learning experiances. We concluded that the best way to teach a student a language is to drop him into an immersive storyline. We went about creating an immersive storyline in two ways:

1. Create a game that allows the student to interact with the world around him.
2. Create a compelling storyline that the student wants to follow.

The two points above guided us from the perspective of the student (which we beleive is most important). Our single guiding idea with regards to the teacher was that we do not want to replace the teacher only offer him/her an app to allow the students to learn without sitting in their seats and memorizing words.

## Idea
The idea was to create an experiance that flows as follows:
1. The teachers goes about teaching some vocabulary in a previous or current lesson
2. The teacher takes the vocabulary list he/she wants the students to memorize and uploads them to our server
3. The teacher receives a 4 digit pin which she must pass out to the students so that they can enter the game (similar to kahoot) 
4. The student enters the pin and then enters them game
5. The game asks the student to help solve the case of the missing monalisa he/she does this by taking pictures of clues.
    * the clues are objects that are placed around the classroom which the student is asked to find given the name of the object in french
    * when the student takes a picture of all the objects the game is over.
